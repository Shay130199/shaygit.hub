1.1.1 Background

A. Introduction 

Websites are produced to connect with the world, it is known for being the most powerful tool for communication. Whether it's promoting business, selling products, creating blogs, or any other reason to make a site. Although websites can bring a lot of recognition for many people that want to promote their work. It can be complicated to figure out how to approach making a website that can attract a wider range of customers to view a site and find it presentable and pleasant to the eyes. This assignment sets individuals to design a responsive site that solves issues such as attempting to publicize and solve real-world problems that web designers might face when creating content. The chosen topic of this website will be a self-promotional portfolio site. This report will focus on the background of a portfolio site, this will cover how it can be a useful tool in solving self-promotional issues. There will also be discussions about wireframes, colour choices, accessibility, GDPR, and Distance Selling throughout this report.

Figure 1: Website and Mobile site


Minimalism in web site design consists of looking and experimenting with different styles of websites including colours transitions layouts fonts navigation bars and space. These are key factors of creating a successful responsive and presentable design. The use of white space will help the customer to read more on the page, It keeps the customer scroll through content. A good example of this is a portfolio site called ‘MarieLauret.fr’. The use of colour can benefit websites to attract more customers medium.mul.li.com expresses that creators can use any colour, there should be a balance of having bright coloured background and a black or white font, to keep the page pleasant for viewers. (Carmichael, 2019)

Typography minimalism in web design should be bold and readable. The layout of the font on the website needs to be displayed in a way where the customer can easily look at it. This will reflect on the whole usability of the service or product that is provided on the website. According to ‘medium.mus.li’ article San serif fonts are used most of the time in modern sites, this font tend is described as clean and crisp to most costumers.
To begin setting up navigation bars, there needs to be a decision in where the the bars. Most navigation bars are either side bars that are on the side of the content page, or top navigation bars thats located above the page, usually under or above the banner of the site. Most websites nowadays have top navigation bars, also these are mostly responsive. A website would have the normal space bars where for example there would be ‘Home’, ‘Services’, ‘Portfolio’, and ‘Contact’, on either the left or right side. Once the website shrinks into a mobile site it can either change its size or turn into a hamburger site, which is a button that will give you menu options, having the ‘Home’, ‘Services’, ‘Portfolio’, and ‘Contact’ pages on the side. (medium.mus.li’, 2018)

C. The problems that need to be attempted to resolve










Figure 3: Website creation

In order to make a successful online portfolio there needs to be a recognition of what problems web designer’s face when It comes to attempting to create a portfolio website for future clients to look at. I would want them to develop and design a whole new website. The first issue of solving this is by making a portfolio site where it doesn’t send out the wrong message. Most web design developers that create portfolios would get overly excited and go beyond creating the sites that cram in a lot of content in pages, and this can be off putting for viewers. Creative boom.com states that “Less is more. It's as simple as that. Consider what your online portfolio is about in a short, snappy sentence and ensure that message is prominent” (Creative boom.com). 

This helped understand that when it comes to promoting your work on a site, the costumer wants to get straight to the point when it comes to reading content. When it comes to sharing to much information, the goal of promoting your work is give less information and potential clients to reach out to you for more information. If you answer all their questions online, you have an opportunity to build a relationship through further contact. (forbes.com, 2020). The other problem is having a well-structured website that is not cluttered wil help the viewer concentrate. 
For a web designer, they  should show off their skills more on the portfolio site, by making the website visually pleasing to the costumers eyes to see what we can offer them. The ‘My work’ page for example should show good examples of work that has been previously done. This will benefit the web designer and the customer. It helps the customer see what the web designers services can do for their business and web designers can make a lot of profit and business from it aswell. Once the website is published online it is time to promote the site on social media including a domain URL link. Not only social media, business cards can help promote as well. It’s best to have a plan of how to promote digitally and physically.

The final common issue is not having SEO in your websites; this is a good way of getting listed in local directions. The titles and descriptions need to be containing buzzwords. There needs to be a tracker on site to see the amount of views the website gets good example is Google Analytics.(Creative boom)

Figure 13: Colour Theory


Colours are used in websites to grab the customers attention. Certain colours can capture the customers emotions and responses Towards the website. This will expand recognition in the business brand. The autonomy of colour needs to be acknowledged before deciding what colour should be picked for your website. Certain colours have many Meanings behind them.The colour red means passion or love, Yellow is more of a friendly,  When people think of this colour, people think of happiness and youthfulness. The colour green could associate with freshness and peace. The colour purple shows power and ambition, Black is also powerful, bold, serious and elegant. Lastly white comes across as being pure and clean. Studio 1 expresses that there should be three different colours in a website. If there're two many colours on a website, and there are no themes, it will make the website look cluttered. They state that “Be careful about using too many colors, too many colors can compete and cause eye fatigue and overwhelm your customers. Introduce new experimental colors in small quantities to reduce risk.” (studio1design.com, 2018)

The portfolio website will be purple black and white. These will be used because the colours suit each other And these colours come across as intelligent and powerful which is important, this is so that future customers know we are a serious company wanting to provide our customers the best functional responsive and creative websites. The main colour of this website will be black, this colourable be used 70%Of the website we are making. The pop colour will be purple. This will be used for example if we have any links the text will be highlighted purple to Highlight very important information for customers. Lastly the neutral colour will be used right for the content boxes I’ll use to make the website spacious.

1.2.7 Evaluation

The justification behind assignment was to create a responsive website or web application to publish for customers that can benefit them in the future .The extent that was made to make this portfolio was to outline the problems that would be faced before making the website.Turn off the designing and look at the problems that have been solved. One of the problems that have been outlined was making sure that there is less on the website such as on the portfolio there is information but it does get straight to the point and also the website is spacious so that the customer can concentrate on what is meant to be looked at. Another problem is that some web designers face when creating portfolio sites are that is visually pleasing to the customers so it doesn’t put them off when viewing the site.Another problem that is believed to be solved is the use of using CEO in the website.On the portfolio site on the homepage at the top of the screen passwords have been used to keep the website relevant. How’s the website was tested by first testing it out on the open live server, Which is provided in Vscode, Which shows you what it would look like on the web browser on Google Chrome. This helped to detect the website was responsive for mobile users. During this process there was a lot of problems trying to make the website responsive.  Although it did help benefit to see what was going wrong. At the end managing to make the website responsive did work at the end. There were many problems trying to make the contact page connect with JavaScript to process the functioning is behind submitting a form.What has informed and influenced this portfolio site was by doing some secondary research on The Internet and looking at some trends and minimalism. What would be improved on this portfolio would be the content that has been put onto the site.
